# Valentine's Day Invite 💕

A responsive, mobile-friendly Valentine's Day invite with a playful "No" button.

## Features

- **Desktop:** The "No" button moves away as your cursor gets closer.
- **Mobile:** Tapping "No" moves it to a random spot on the screen.
- **Yes:** Clicking "Yes!" shows a success message.

## How to run

```bash
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

The app will open in your browser (default: http://localhost:5173). Use the same URL on your phone (same Wi‑Fi) to test the mobile “No” button behavior.
