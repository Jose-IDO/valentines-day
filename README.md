# Valentine's Day Invite 💕

A responsive, mobile-friendly Valentine's Day invite with a playful "No" button.

## Features

- **Desktop:** The "No" button moves away as your cursor gets closer.
- **Mobile:** Tapping "No" moves it to a random spot on the screen.
- **Yes:** Clicking "Yes!" shows a success message.

## How to run

```bash
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

The app will open in your browser (default: http://localhost:5173). Use the same URL on your phone (same Wi‑Fi) to test the mobile “No” button behavior.

## Deploy

The app is set up to deploy to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `master`. After pushing:

1. In your repo go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. After the “Deploy to GitHub Pages” workflow runs, the site will be at:
   **https://jose-ido.github.io/valentines-day/**
